## The Tension

Zenote is about **calm, simplicity, and letting go** — aggressive monetization (paywalls, upsells, "upgrade now!" prompts) would contradict that spirit.

## Models That Align Well

### 1. Generous Free + Thoughtful Paid
- Free tier that's genuinely useful (not crippled)
- Paid tier for power users who *want* more, not who *need* to escape limitations
- Example gates that feel natural: sync across unlimited devices, image attachments, higher storage

### 2. Patronage / "Support Zenote"
- Everything free, optional contribution
- Aligns with wabi-sabi's embrace of generosity
- Risk: Harder to sustain unless you have significant adoption

### 3. One Fair Price (No Tiers)
- Like buying a quality Muji notebook — one price, you own it
- Example: $29/year or $5/month, no feature gates
- Simple, honest, no decision fatigue

### 4. Pay Once, Use Forever
- One-time purchase with optional yearly support
- Feels like buying a physical journal
- Harder to sustain ongoing development costs

## What Would Feel "Off"

- Ads (destroys the calm)
- Feature walls that interrupt flow
- "You've reached your limit" messages
- Dark patterns or urgency tactics

## Recommended Approach

A **generous free tier + one simple paid option** feels most aligned:

> *Zenote is free. If it brings you calm, consider supporting its quiet existence for $4/month.*

No feature gates needed — just trust and reciprocity. The users who value calm will understand paying for something that respects their attention.

This mirrors how quality stationery works: you pay for the craft, not because cheaper paper doesn't exist.
